About two years old and would do well in a family with older kids and another dog. He’s very obedient. He’s working on controlling his greeting enthusiasm - jumping.  He’s active but not a constant need.  He’s affectionate and wants LOVE.",

        description: "Liam is a dapper dude with a head as round and smooth as a honeydew melon. And his imploring round eyes like golden quarters.  He is a boxer and Staffordshire terrier mix.  We have been fostering Liam for eight months and he is looking for another lucky person/family for mutually beneficial, loving companionship. Liam is a cool dog if he had to be summarized in one word.  nothing much ruffles his feathers.  He’s extremely obedient and deferential to human instruction. If correction is too vocally harsh, he will cower - which is sad and guilt invoking. He loves to snuggle and cuddle especially on the couch and in bed.  He loves a walk/bursts of trotting and also ride in the car. He is E collar trained and is also generally obedient off leash. Not much is known about Liam’s previous life.  He came from the Fayetteville area where dogs are surrendered when military members are moved. He was not neutered when he arrived and appeared to be on the young side. He was underweight. He has since been neutered and and the staff at the neuter clinic were enamored with him. Liam has an impressive prey drive for squirrels and deer.  He gets along well with non-reactive dogs. He is a very problem-free boy and doesn’t really ask for anything. He doesn’t bark. He is not demanding. However, he does really enjoy attention and interacting and cuddling.  He is a confident boy when meeting new dogs. Given Liam’s laid-back and adaptable nature, he would likely do well in most environments.  He does not jump. He could be a solo dog if he was not alone all the time.  He would also do well with another non-reactive dog in the home - especially a female one. My dogs are on a foster to adopt basis so that all parties know that it’s a good fit. If it is not a fit immediately or at any time in the future, the dog must be returned to me. I also do in-home support and transition. The introduction process is based on familiarity with the dog and the people and increasing time together.",
